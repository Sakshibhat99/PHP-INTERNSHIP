      <p align="justify">Wild City is a futuristic racing game with several unique mechanics. It draws inspiration from other
          high-speed racing games such as F-Zero and Wipeout.</p>
      <p>Here are a few key ideals:</p><br/>
      
      <h3>Speed and Sense of Speed</h3>
<p align="justify">The game uses camera motion and movement effects such as motion blur to
    make the players feel as if they’re racing at several hundred miles per hour.</p><br/>
              
              <h3>Balanced Skill vs. Luck</h3>
<p align="justify">Racing games require careful balancing. Since the race tracks exist in three
dimensions, there are literally multiple paths to victory, which reward
ambitious drivers’ excellent navigation skills. Less savvy drivers can instead
gamble with power-ups and manual boosting to come out ahead.</p><br/>
              
              <h3>Unique Environment Effects</h3>
<p align="justify">Race tracks are dynamic and evolving through movement and random
chance. While some parts might be stationary, others contain segments of
slowly undulating segments, creating an ever-changing course that keeps
drivers on their toes. Some power-ups allow players to manipulate the
environments to their advantage, much to the chagrin of other racers.</p>
