                    <p><img src="images/IMAGE 2.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" /></p>
			<p align="justify">This annual plant is scientifically known as Rudbeckia. This type of flower is often confused with Daisies.
                            However, Black-eyed Susans are usually taller (as they can reach up to 4 feet in height), and they will
                            bloom in late summer. They require lots of sunlight to survive and well-drained soil.</p>

			<p><img src="images/IMAGE 1.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" /></p>
                        <p align="justify">Bird of Paradise,known as Strelitzia, is a perennial flower. Its yellow variety is very exotic! They need to be exposed to full sunlight; otherwise, they wonâ€™t thrive. </p>

			<h2>Calendulas</h2>
			<p><img src="images/IMAGE 3.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" /></p>
                        <p align="justify">Calendulas are scientifically referred to as Calendula officinalis. They are not only edible flowers, 
                            but they will also deter any pests away from the garden. Calendulas are known for being a very powerful flower with many health benefits as well! </p>
