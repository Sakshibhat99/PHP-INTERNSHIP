                    <p><img src="images/IMAGE 2.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" /></p>
			<p align="justify">This annual plant is scientifically known as Rudbeckia. This type of flower is often confused with Daisies.
                            However, Black-eyed Susans are usually taller (as they can reach up to 4 feet in height), and they will
                            bloom in late summer. They require lots of sunlight to survive and well-drained soil.</p>

                        <p align="justify">Bird of Paradise,known as Strelitzia, is a perennial flower. Its yellow variety is very exotic! They need to be exposed to full sunlight; otherwise, they won’t thrive. </p>

                        <p align="justify">Calendulas are scientifically referred to as Calendula officinalis. They are not only edible flowers, 
                            but they will also deter any pests away from the garden. Calendulas are known for being a very powerful flower with many health benefits as well! </p>

					<p align="justify" ><strong>Fashion Flowers</strong>, believes that “Politeness is the flower of 
                                            humanity.”.Flowers are one of nature’s most beautiful gifts to man and it would not be 
                                            wrong to say that the blooming of a flower in itself symbolises life. plants produce 
                                            flowers because they contain the male and female reproductive organs. Like human beings
                                            plants also need to transfer Pollen from the male reproductive organs to the female ones.
                                            Unlike human beings and animals, plants cannot move so they need to attract other creatures
                                            which can do this job for them and for this purpose they produce flowers. Flowers have a 
                                            delicate but complex structure and no two flowers are alike. Before blooming, a flower is
                                            in the shape of a bud and is covered on the outside with scaly and rough sepals.</p>
